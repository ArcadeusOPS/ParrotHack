# Drone Hacking Scripts
A Parrot Bebop drone was handy so we decided to teach our Trainees some WiFi hacking. <br/>
You'll need to install this on Kali Linux. These scripts were tested on a Raspberry Pi 4 B+ 4 GB. <br/>
The WiFi adapter was an ALFA AWUS036ACH but we built an extended pair of antennas to mount on a Yagi antenna for more gain and directional control. <br/>

# Scripts
connectOpenNetwork.sh is for a WiFi connection that is not password protected. <br/>
connectSecureNetwork.sh is for a WiFi connection that is password protected. We used the rockyou.txt password file. <br/>
